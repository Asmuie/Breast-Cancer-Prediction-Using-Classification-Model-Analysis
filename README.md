# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Classification-Model-Analysis

**[Breast Cancer Data Set](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/disl/VISTA/breast.html)**: This breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. The idea is to perform an exploratory analysis of the information contained in the dataset, figuring out ways of making the dataset tidier. The ultimate objective is to, in the end, build and compare models to predict if a given tumor is benign or malignant (breast cancer) using the information available on this dataset. Some functions created for this purpose are included in the repository.

* Number of Instances : 699
* Number of Attributes : 10

1. Sample code number id number 
2. Clump Thickness 1 - 10 
3. Uniformity of Cell Size 1 - 10 
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape 1 - 10 
5. Marginal Adhesion 1 - 10 
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size 1 - 10 
7. Bare Nuclei 1 - 10 
8. Bland Chromatin 1 - 10 
9. Normal Nucleoli 1 - 10 
10. Mitoses 1 - 10 
11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)

* Class distribution:
  * Benign: 458(65.5%)
  * Malignant: 241 (34.5)

Using the data provided, I predict if the patient had benign or malignant tumor using classification model below. Finally i compare the accuracy score method to find the best possible model for this project.

* Logistic Regression

* K Nearest Neighbors

* Support Vector Machine (SVM)

* Kernel SVM

* Naive Bayes

* Decision Tree Classification

* Random Forest Classification

By using accuracy score method we can evaluate our classification model preformance and compare it with other model. The accuracy score show that, with a Decision Tree Classification model, we can predict if a given tumor is benign or malignant with 95.9% of accuracy.
